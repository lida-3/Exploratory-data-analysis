# Exploratory data analysis
NLP project made for my Master's Thesis

My thesis deals with the topic of data analysis by natural language text processing. 
Technologies used for retrieving data published on the web portal of the Ministry of Defence, Republic of Croatia were studied and a system for articles collection published on the same portal is implemented. 
Regular expressions were applied through natural language processing techniques to extract the desired, structured data from the articles. Data on firefighting activities of the air forces were collected from the archive (2009-2022). The collected data were analysed and the results were presented visually.

In this repository is shown just a part of data collection and visalisation for years 2018-2021.
